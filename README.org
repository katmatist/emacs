** About
A powerful emacs configuration for working with Ruby on Rails.  It
supports all the programming and markup languages used by Rails, and
includes a pack of robotic emonkeys to make your life easier.

The configuration depends on the el-get.el package manager for emacs. It
helps manage package updates, and provides an easy, consistent way to
describe and customize package recipes.
